  What is :target

  :target is a CSS pseudo-class. If you have worked with HTML and CSS even a little, you will be familiar with :hover. The :hover pseudo-class is a user action pseudo-class, whereas :target is a location pseudo-class.

  Both user action and target pseudo-classes are used on links. The difference being location based pseudo-classes are concerned with the link element or target element of a link regardless of the users current interaction with the page.

  Let's take a simple example of how the target pseudo-class can be used.

  How do you use :target

  For :target to work we need a link and an element. From the link we can target any element. We do this by using an #id. In the link href we use the id of the target. This can be on the same page or on another page.

  In the below example we have a link that targets the h2 with an id that starts with anchor.  I am using the prefix here so I can use an attribute selector in the CSS.

  I will use the attribute selector here so I can use the same code for all links (If using this and 2 headings are visible will they all highlight - think they will)

  Next we add the target pseudo-class to the element or selector. When adding the :target pseudo-class you can add to the id or you can also add it to the element selector. In the example below I have added it to the h2. This means you can target any h2 from a link and the target rule will work.
